# QML - Quantum Machine Learning

A compact, hands-on implementation and set of notebooks for exploring Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with a focus on Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and Quantum k-Nearest Neighbor (q-NN). This repository provides educational notebooks, example scripts and utilities for:
* building quantum feature maps/embeddings,
* training variational quantum models (QNNs)
* implementing quantum-enhanced similarity/kernel methods,
* running experiments on simulators and (optionally) quantum backends,
* visualizing and analyzing results with clear baselines and metrics.
